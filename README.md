[OpenComputers](https://github.com/MightyPirates/OpenComputers) is an amazing mod for Minecraft. I really love it !

And developers there are very friendly. You can submit a new issue if you find something wrong, or you can join the IRC and talk to them directly~!

Also [view it on Minecraft CurseForge](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/opencomputers) too

## Quick Setup

Select all content of [update.lua](update.lua) and copy to clipboard. Switch to Minecraft and open any computer. Type `edit update`, then paste the code (use middle button of mouse). Save (ctrl+s) and close (ctrl+w) the editor. Then use `update` to setup basic libraries.

Notice that `update.lua` needs an internet card to download files.
