[OpenComputers](https://github.com/MightyPirates/OpenComputers) is an amazing mod for Minecraft. I really love it !

And developers there are very friendly. You can submit a new issue if you find something wrong, or you can join the IRC and talk to them directly~!

Also [view it on Minecraft CurseForge](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/opencomputers) too
